// The purpose of the exercises given in this series is to help you become a pro in coding. The problem you are going to solve is very interesting. The task is to create a C Language program that works as a Travel Agency Manager.

// Instructions:-
// You manage a travel agency, and you want your n drivers to input their following details:

// Name of the driver
// Driving License Number
// Route 
// Kms
// Your program should be able to take n as input (or you can take n=3 for simplicity), and your drivers will start inputting their details one by one. Your program should print details of the drivers in a beautiful fashion. For this task, you have to use Structure only. These four inputs: name, driving license number, route, and km information will be struct members. After creating struct, you have to create its array of size “n.” 

// Solving exercises is the best way to improve your coding skills. Have you solved this problem? If yes, then it’s time to check your solution. The solution is given in tutorial#46.
